            Josh raced to pick up bacon, he ran down the street as fast as he
            could!
            <br />
            He wanted her to come over and thought if he had bacon for the bread
            then she would.
            <br />
            Thatâ€™s when Josh started going out of his way to see her and liked
            her more and more,
            <br />
            And neither of them had any idea what all was in store.
